Must have these installed and working:
- The "Command Line Compass Calibration Program" found here:
    https://www.phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=10&pcid=8&prodid=32
    (make sure all the required drivers are installed)

- The Phidgets IMU launch file "imu.launch", which should exist in
    catkin_ws/src/phidgets_drivers/phidgets_imu/launch/
    if you build this ROS package (https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/phidgets_drivers)
    with catkin.
    If this the command "rosdep install libphidgets" fails to install, try
    cloning in the libphidgets package
    (https://github.com/ipa320/cob_extern/tree/hydro_release_candidate)

This script runs the Command Line Compass Calibration Program above and stores
the results into the imu.launch file in the ROS node above. So when the imu is
started (roslaunch phidgets_imu imu.launch), it will use the values from the
latest calibration.

Usage:
- Place the script ("calibrate.cpp") in the same folder as the Command Line Compass
    Calibration Program ("compasscal").
- Edit the script: change the FILEPATH and BACKUP_FILEPATH constants to match
    the path of the imu.launch file on your system. BACKUP_FILEPATH is the path
    where a backup copy of imu.launch is to be created before it is modified.
- Compile using the command "g++ calibrate.cpp -o calibrate" in that directory.
- Plug in the IMU and run using the command "./calibrate"

Limitations:
- If no imu is detected, the program will pretend to work and then not say anything
    after it finishes. (If the program is successful, it should spit out a bunch of
    stuff.) Therefore it is recommended to run the compasscal program first to
    check if the IMU can be calibrated manually.
- If sampling is started and stopped in rapid succession, a math error will occur
    causing the calibration program to run into an infinite loop. To prevent this the script force sampling to last a minimum of 3 seconds before it can be stopped.
