This script runs the Command Line Compass Calibration Program and stores
the results into the imu.launch file in the ROS node above. So when the imu is
started (roslaunch boat_nav imu.launch), it will use the values from the
latest calibration.

Usage:
- Place the script ("calibrate.cpp") in the same folder as the Command Line Compass
    Calibration Program ("compasscal").
- Edit the script: change the FILEPATH and BACKUP_FILEPATH constants to match
    the path of the imu.launch file on your system. BACKUP_FILEPATH is the path
    where a backup copy of imu.launch is to be created before it is modified.
- Compile using the command "g++ calibrate.cpp -o calibrate" in that directory.
- Plug in the IMU and run using the command "./calibrate"

Limitations:
- If no imu is detected, the program will pretend to work and then not say anything
    after it finishes. (If the program is successful, it should spit out a bunch of
    stuff.) Therefore it is recommended to run the compasscal program first to
    check if the IMU can be calibrated manually.
- If sampling is started and stopped in rapid succession, a math error will occur
    causing the calibration program to run into an infinite loop. To prevent this the script force sampling to last a minimum of 3 seconds before it can be stopped.
