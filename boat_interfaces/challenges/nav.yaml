# Path is a list of boat_msgs/Waypoint-like maps
# The x and y fields describe the point's location
# The lps field describes whether the x and y should be treated as meters from origin or coordinates
# The round field describes whether the waypoint should be TYPE_ROUND or TYPE_INTERSECT
# TODO: Make the round field more versatile for more waypoint types
